# Git Conflict

The Git Conflict task gives you the power to never commit a merge conflict again. It uses internal git commands to determine if there are any merge conflicts in your current repository.
It lives under the `git_conflict` namespace and has following configurable parameters:

```yaml
# grumphp.yml
parameters:
    tasks:
        git_conflict: ~
```
